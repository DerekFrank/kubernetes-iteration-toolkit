    Create a namespace within the cluster
  workspaces:
  - name: config
    description: |
      A workspace into which a kubeconfig file called `kubeconfig` will be written that will contain the information required to access the cluster. The `kubeconfig` will expect to use [aws-iam-authenticator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator/) to authenticate, so in order for it to be used it must be run in a container which contains both `kubectl` and `aws-iam-authenticator`.
  steps:
  - name: create namespace

    script: |
      kubeconfig create namespace karpenter --kubeconfig $(workspaces.config.path)/kubeconfig
